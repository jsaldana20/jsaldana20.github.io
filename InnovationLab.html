     <h1 style="position:relative;text-align:center;"> What is Innovation Lab?</h1>

    <h2 style="position:relative;text-align:center;"> The Innovation Lab @ Ross is an academy at the Ross School that is designed for people who have interests in science, mathematics, engineering, media, and technology. This program enables student to conduct independent projects that undertake a certain field of their interests.

      <h2> Week 1</h2>
       <p>So far in my project I have created various different sketches and designs for the design for my clothes. I came up with a name for a clothing company which would be "Genuinisty" where I aim on showing my "true self" with my very own designs that I like. I have already made a logo for my company which is made of different prisms together and two lines that I created that curve back and forth that I will use on my clothing as well. I plan creating these images through photoshop. My two logo name designs consist of a bubble letter and a fancy cursive font. I want to learn how to make these logos on photoshop for next week so that I can place these images on my clothes. I also choose to create hoodies and sweaters instead of shirts, one reason I'm doing this because the winter season is coming and more people are willing to buy soft, comfy, and warm sweaters to keep themselves warm instead of t shirts while it's snowing. I also choose to do a navy blue color for my sweaters and hoodies because than it would easily fit with the ross theme since the uniforms are navy blue. My plans for the next two weeks are to finish making my logo designs on photoshop and order a sample navy blue hoodie to experiment with my designs.</p>
