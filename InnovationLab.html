     <h1 style="position:relative;text-align:center;"> What is Innovation Lab?</h1>

    <h2 style="position:relative;text-align:center;"> The Innovation Lab @ Ross is an academy at the Ross School that is designed for people who have interests in science, mathematics, engineering, media, and technology. This program enables student to conduct independent projects that undertake a certain field of their interests.

      <h2> Week 1</h2>
       <p>So far in my project I have created various different sketches and designs for the design for my clothes. I came up with a name for a clothing company which would be "Genuinisty" where I aim on showing my "true self" with my very own designs that I like. I have already made a logo for my company which is made of different prisms together and two lines that I created that curve back and forth that I will use on my clothing as well. I plan creating these images through photoshop. My two logo name designs consist of a bubble letter and a fancy cursive font. I want to learn how to make these logos on photoshop for next week so that I can place these images on my clothes. I also choose to create hoodies and sweaters instead of shirts, one reason I'm doing this because the winter season is coming and more people are willing to buy soft, comfy, and warm sweaters to keep themselves warm instead of t shirts while it's snowing. I also choose to do a navy blue color for my sweaters and hoodies because than it would easily fit with the ross theme since the uniforms are navy blue. My plans for the next two weeks are to finish making my logo designs on photoshop and order a sample navy blue hoodie to experiment with my designs.</p>

       <h2> Week 2 </h2>
       <P> This week I further did research in screen printing by jotting down the steps to screenprint from a video I watched. These are the steps that I have written down 
        Supplies to screen print:
       <ol>
         <li>Transparencies (with art design on it)</li>
         <li>Squeegee (a tool with a flat smooth rubber blade that is used to control the flow of liquid on a flat surface)</li>
         <li>Frame</li>
          <li>Emulsion</li>
         <li>Sensitizer</li>
          <li>Glass</li>
          <li>Ink</li>
        </ol>

How to screen print:
        <ol>
      <li>Add a little water to my sensitizer and mix it up, loosens it from the sides of the bottle.</li>
         <li>Pour sensitizer into emulsion.</li>
      <li>Mix all together really well till it is a consistent green color.</li>
       <li>Once color is consistent, pour it onto the screen. </li>
         <li>Spread upon screen with squeegee, dont use too much.</li>
       <li>Make sure to cover the entire screen where your arts going to be and make sure it is even (do not leave the screen out in the light, put a fan to dry and turn the lights off, you want the screen to dry in the dark)</li>
        <li>Once dry, you want to work quick since it is photo sensitive, the longer the light is on it, the quicker it is going to set. </li>
         <li>Print out your art on transparencies (you can do this in any office supply store)</li>
           <li>Lay them backwards on the back of the screen.</li>
           <li>Lay a piece of glass over the transparencies to push it down against the screen</li>
           <li>Set a really bright light on top of the glass and transparencies for about 30-45 minutes</li>
           <ul>
<li>The light exposes and hardens the emulsion that is not covered by the design (You can see that the lighter green area with the design did not get exposed)</li>
        </ul>
          <li>Use a light spray or a tooth brush to remove the area around the light green.</li>
          <ul>
<li> The dark green area acts as a mask, the lighter green or white area lets the ink though onto the surface that you are printing on.</li>
          </ul>
         <li>You want to brush the area around your design gently because you dont want to remove anything that you actually need.</li>
         <ul>
<li>May take some time, sometimes you might make mistakes</li>
<li>If there are areas of mistakes or stuff you dont want to print yet, you can use some tape to cover it up (Use painters tape, NOT duct tape since the duct tape will rip off the emulsion) </li>
        </ul>
<li>Lay out your shirt or any clothing and place your screen over the area of the clothing you want to screen print</li>
         <li>Add a bit of screen printing ink</li>
         <li>Pull the squeegee down across your print with the ink</li>
         <ul>
<li>Best to have someone hold down your screen when doing this or use clamps</li>
        </ul>
         <li>You want to heat set the ink on your shirt or clothing piece by putting it in the drier for a few minutes</li>
         <li>You can reuse the screens when you are finished with them by putting some photo emulsion remover on top of the screen with emulsion</li>
         <ul>
<li>Simple solution that you can just scrub off with a paper towel or a tooth brush</li>
<li>Make sure to scrub the photo emulsion remover on both sides of the screen</li>
<li>Photo emulsion does not have to stay on for more than a couple of minutes</li>
<li>Then you can get a hose and wash out all the emulsion</li>
<li>Sometimes when using dark ink, it may stain the screen itself but you can still reprint through them as long as the emulsion is gone</li>
          </ul>
More info about screen printing:
            <ul> 
<li>Screen printing works on textiles, like any shirt, canvas, bag, aprons, hats (if there is a flat enough surface, and all sorts of stuff</li>
<li>Just make sure to heat set the print into the clothing by placing it into the drier for a couple of minutes</li>
<li>Also print of paper if you want to make posters or invitation</li>
<li>You can even screen print on wood to print your logo or some sort</li>
<li>You can even screen print metal just make sure to put some sort of clear coat over it to protect it because it tends to scrape off of the metal pretty easily</li>
</ul>

I also have ordered my hoodies to experiment my designs on. I ordered a medium sized, some what light blue hoodie and a small black hoodie. I plan to finish screen printing my designs onto the hoodies or have an idea what I want to design by Friday. I already got the frame, squeegee, and ink and am ready to print. </p>

  <h2>Week 3</h2>
  <p>This week I have recieved the two hoodies that I ordered from last week and I also got white ink to print onto my hoodies. I moved the frame from the art room to the Innovation Lab so that I can start screen printing. I also finished my basic logo design for my company and hope to screen print it on my hoodies. Over the Thanksgiving break, I will do further research on how to maintain a fashion company and sketch out additional ideas and designs so that when I come back from break, I will be prepared to screen print and get back to work.

        <h1> Lamp Design Module </h1>
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p> The Lamp Design Module is a project where we make our own lamps using three different types pf materials, wood, metal, and ceramics. This project helped me get a better understanding on how to use the saws in the classroom and think outside the box with my ideas. For my lamp I want to make it based off of mahagony wood and metal that would whelded to cover the sides of my wooden base and make it look decorative and creative. With the wood, I wanted to make a joint system for my lamp consisting of mahagony. </p>
        <p>My joint system design was that I wanted to put a notch in one piece of wood, most likely the base of the lamp, and than have a hole for the notch on the other piece of wood. With this design, since I have 2 joints in my lamp it would allow my lamp to move in two different directions like moving forward or back or moving the light higher or lower. During this module I am now getting better at mechanisms and tools that I might use in the future. These include the table saw, hand saw, sand paper, and the drills.</p>
         <p>To complete this project I am going to need to sand and wax all the pieces of wood I have to make it look nice, I also need to place wood glue because you might have noticed that the pieces consist of two pieces. I want to put wood glue on the parts to make it look like it was one piece.I also need to whelding shop to make my metal design for the sides of my base, I am thinking of doing a wave design. With these steps finished all I would need to do is drill holes through the pieces where there will be a joing and with that I will place the joints, and I need toinstall all the wiring to the lamp for it to turn on and off. After all of this, I will have a fully functioning lamp.</p>
