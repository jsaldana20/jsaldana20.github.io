          <h2>Bio</h2>
  			<p>I am a 15 year old 10th grader and my interests and hobbies consist of photography, clothing and design thinking, screen printing, basketball, film making, and drawing. I have been at the Ross School and the Innovation Lab for 2 years. My favorite subject is art for many reasons.  I like to think creatively when it comes to drawing sketches of my hands to drawing logo designs for a clothing company. In the end I like to always be thinking because I like to distract myself from everything around me and focus on something that I really like, that something for me is art.</p>

          <p style="position: relative;"> This year in Innovation Lab I want to learn and devlope new skills that I find interesting and will help me in the future. I first want to make a clothing company, I have many sketches and plan to learn how to screen print because that will be very useful when it comes to designing clothes. To take this step up a notch I want to establish a website for this clothing company of mine and use Paypal so that I can sell my clothes. I want to consist this website with photos of my clothes and videos to promote my company. Overall I want to do this project because I want to go to college and study business administration and create my own company, with this I'll have more experience in creating a website and starting a business.</p>
